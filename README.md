# MDNTutorial
MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) Tutorial

The MDNTutorial repository will be used by me for two purposes: 1) become acquainted with using Git within Visual Studio Code, GitHub Desktop, and
GitHub on the Web, 2) learn how to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) tutorials.
